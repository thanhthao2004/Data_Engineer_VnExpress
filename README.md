# üìä Insights from Analysis of community interest in online news articles about diseases
<img width="1002" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b52fc8-0575-4adb-990b-fa945e027edf" />
* **"Nhi So sinh" (congenital heart defects)** is currently the most prominent topic, capturing the highest audience attention with **22.85% of the total comments and likes**. This indicates a significant interest or a high demand for information regarding this specific condition.
* Other topics such as **"Ung th∆∞" (cancer) at 16.45% and "Tim m·∫°ch" (cardiovascular diseases) at 14.51%** also receive substantial engagement, suggesting these are top health concerns within this news-reading community.
* Although the **total number of likes (3297)** significantly outweighs the **total number of comments (2020)**, the average **comment/like rate (0.61)** suggests that readers tend to express their support or interest by liking articles rather than actively participating in discussions through comments.
* The line chart illustrates the fluctuation in engagement levels (comments and likes) across different disease categories. Further analysis is needed to pinpoint **specific times when certain diseases experienced a surge in attention**, potentially linked to medical events, seasons, or information trends.
* The scatter plot reveals the correlation between the **average number of comments and the total number of likes** for each disease. Diseases located in the upper right quadrant (e.g., seemingly "Ung th∆∞" and "Tim m·∫°ch") indicate a combination of a large interested audience and a higher propensity for discussion.
* The **average content length of articles** on various diseases also differs (represented by the "Avg of count content word" line). Comparing this length with engagement metrics could suggest the **preferred content format** of readers for specific health topics. For instance, do more complex subjects require longer articles that still maintain audience interaction?

<img width="1006" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f93e611e-bb83-4273-9ae4-5ffe2776befc" />
* **Summer and Winter see the most reported diseases.** Summer has the highest count (35.90%), closely followed by Winter (35.41%). Spring has the lowest (27.1%).
* **Disease occurrences change over time and by season.** The stacked area chart shows how different diseases fluctuate within each season across the years. Some diseases likely spike during specific seasons.
* **Overall disease counts vary over time.** The line chart shows periods with more or fewer total reported illnesses. These peaks might align with specific seasons.
* **Different diseases likely have different seasonal patterns.** We need to look at individual disease trends to see which ones are more common in which seasons (e.g., winter for respiratory issues, summer for digestive problems).
**Key takeaway:** Disease prevalence appears to be influenced by the seasons, with Summer and Winter having the highest numbers. Further analysis of individual disease trends is needed to understand specific seasonal patterns.
